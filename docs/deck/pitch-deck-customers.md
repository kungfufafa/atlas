# Atlas — Customer Pitch Deck (ASD-STE100)

**Audience:** Team leads and agencies  
**Goal:** Open the public demo, or install with Docker  
**Length:** About 11 slides (8 to 12 minutes)

Copy follows ASD-STE100 practice where possible: short sentences, active voice, approved simple wording, vertical lists, noun clusters of three words or fewer, and no slang or metaphor. Product names (Atlas, ChatGPT, Docker, Telegram, and others) are technical names.

## Slide 1 — Title

**Atlas**

Stop shared work in private ChatGPT chats. Run one agent workspace for your team.

Atlas gives each team or each client agents, memory, and channels on one platform.

## Slide 2 — The problem

**Teams need more than ChatGPT. Agent tools for one operator do not scale.**

1. **Many private chats** — Each person uses a private ChatGPT chat. The team does not share agents, memory, or control.
2. **Tools for one operator** — Tools such as OpenClaw and Hermes work on one machine for one person.
3. **Teams and agencies need more** — They need many users, many clients, channels, and roles.

---

## Slide 3 — Who can use Atlas

**Atlas serves two types of buyers.**

| Buyer | Need |
| --- | --- |
| **Team lead** (operations, support, founder) | Shared agents on the web, Telegram, and WhatsApp. Not only personal ChatGPT. |
| **Agency or freelancer** | One platform for many client organizations. Isolated agents, memory, and channels for each client. |

---

## Slide 4 — Solution

**Atlas is a multi-tenant platform for AI agents.**

You can install Atlas on your servers, as with WordPress. You can also use managed hosting.

- One server can serve many organizations.
- Agents have identity (soul), memory, skills, and tools.
- Channels connect to the tools that teams already use.
- Roles include admin, member, and viewer.

---

## Slide 5 — Feature 1: Organizations and roles

**Atlas is multi-tenant by design.**

- Organizations are tenants.
- You can send invites and assign roles: admin, member, viewer.
- Profiles, sessions, automations, tools, and usage stay isolated by organization.
- Agencies: One installation can serve many client workspaces.

---

## Slide 6 — Feature 2: Souls and memory

**Agents keep context across sessions. Agents do not use only temporary chats.**

Each profile has these soul files:

| File | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `SOUL.md` | Identity |
| `STYLE.md` | Voice |
| `INSTRUCTIONS.md` | Operating rules |
| `MEMORY.md` | Facts across sessions |

Team knowledge increases over time. Client organizations stay separate.

---

## Slide 7 — Feature 3: Channels

**Use the channels that your team already uses.**

- Web dashboard and CLI
- Telegram, WhatsApp, and Discord
- The same agent and the same soul operate across channels.
- Automations and tasks do recurring work.

---

## Slide 8 — Work examples

**Atlas agents can do these tasks:**

Connect external apps with Composio. Assign skills and tools to each profile.

1. **Documents** — Connect Google Drive, Docs, and Sheets. Read and change documents.
2. **Calendar** — Create, change, and review calendar events.
3. **Email** — Read email. Write and send replies.
4. **Short video** — Configure an agent to edit short videos.
5. **Coding agent** — Start Codex, Claude Code, OpenCode, or Cursor Agent. Write and change code, including Atlas itself.
6. **Automations** — Schedule agent work on a timer for recurring tasks.

---

## Slide 9 — Comparison

**Atlas is not only a chatbot. Atlas is not a tool for one operator.**

| Function | ChatGPT / Claude Team | OpenClaw-style | **Atlas** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Shared team agents | Limited | One operator | **Yes** |
| Multi-tenant orgs | No | No | **Yes** |
| Channels | Limited | Often available | **Yes** |
| Durable memory | Chat history | One machine | **Org and profile** |
| Deployment | SaaS only | One local system | **Docker or Cloud** |

Atlas is a platform for team agents.

---

## Slide 10 — Evidence

**Atlas is open source. A public demo is available.**

- **200** GitHub stars
- **22** forks
- **7** contributors
- Public demo: [demo.getatlas.cloud](https://demo.getatlas.cloud)
- Documentation: [kungfufafa.github.io/atlas](https://kungfufafa.github.io/atlas/)
- Managed hosting: [getatlas.cloud](https://getatlas.cloud/)

Update the star and fork counts before each talk.

---

## Slide 11 — Start a test

**Open the public demo. Install Atlas with Docker when you are ready.**

**1. Public demo**  
[demo.getatlas.cloud](https://demo.getatlas.cloud)  
`demo@getatlas.cloud` / `demo1234`

**2. Install with Docker**

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/kungfufafa/atlas:latest
docker run -d -p 4310:4310 -v atlas-data:/atlas/data --name atlas \
  ghcr.io/kungfufafa/atlas:latest
```

Open the dashboard: `http://localhost:4310`

**3. Managed hosting**  
If you do not want to install Atlas, use [getatlas.cloud](https://getatlas.cloud/).
